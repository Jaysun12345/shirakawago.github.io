        <h2 id="gassho_houses">Gassho Houses</h2>
        Gassho-zukuri and is extremely rare in Japan. No nails or any other metal materials were used during the construction of the houses. Instead, houses were made with natural resources found in the area such as wood for the structure and straw for the roof. Gassho-zukuri, or Gassho-style, refers to the shape of the roof. “Gassho” means “joining your hands together in prayer”, and the roof resembles the shape of the hands (and arms) of a praying Buddhist monk.

        <h2 id="history-and-trade">History and Trade</h2>
        For a long time, Ogimachi and the rest of the Shirakawa-go area were cut off from the world around them due to their location in the mountains, but its people managed to survive and maintain their way of life by cultivating mulberry trees and breeding silkworms that lived on these trees in order to trade and sell raw silk. During the cold winters, people would raise these silkworms in the rafters of their Gassho houses whilst living in the lower levels.

        <h2 id="community">Community</h2>
        Everything in Shirakawa-go is a team effort, from educating the children about the history of the area to refurbishing and reconstructing the roofs of the Gassho-zukuri houses and protecting their homeland from disaster including fire. Since they also learn disaster prevention, it’s one of the reasons why the village is still able to exist the way it does. The homes here are still proudly family-owned. When it comes to the future of these priceless homes, there’s a local motto “don’t sell, don’t lend, don’t destroy”.
